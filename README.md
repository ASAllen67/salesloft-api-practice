### 3. Build a simple web app

In this last part you will submit a web application with two features:

1. Show a list of People records that are available via the [SalesLoft API](https://developers.salesloft.com/api.html#!/People/get_v2_people_json) using the API key in the email you received. Display each personâ€™s name, email address, and job title.
2. Create a button that, when clicked, displays a frequency count of all the **unique** characters in all the email addresses of all the People you have access to, sorted by frequency count.

| Character | Count |
| --------- | ----- |
| M         | 7     |
| R         | 5     |
| S         | 2     |

At SalesLoft we love building quality software and we like to write code other people enjoy working with. Here are the elements we consider important:

- Usability. Having a working application is the first step, right?
- Deployment. It would be cool to use the application in the cloud!
- Documentation. Instructions are important and we want to see the reasons behind your development choices.
- Tests. A test written today is 10 bugs that will not pop up tomorrow!
- Git. Commit soon and commit often. Branches make cooperative work way easier.
- Readability. Code should be written for other people to work on: names, indentation, spaces. Everything matters.
- Frontend frameworks. Do you know any of the numerous frameworks out there? Are you using your choice to your advantage?
- Development principles. There are different ways to write code. The important thing is doing it deliberately.

Remember, what you learn during these exercises is more important than what you knew before starting!

Good Luck!
